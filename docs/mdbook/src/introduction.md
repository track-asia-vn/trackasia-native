# Introduction

*[Trackasia Native](https://github.com/track-asia-vn/trackasia-native)* is a community led fork of *Mapbox GL Native*. It's a C++ library that powers 
vector maps in native applications on multiple platforms by taking stylesheets that conform to the *Trackasia Style Specification,* a fork of the 
Trackasia Style Spec. Since it is derived from Mapbox's original work it also uses *Mapbox Vector Tile Specification* as its choice of vector tile format.
